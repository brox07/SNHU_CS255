Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- DriverPass was the client.  They wanted a system designed to provide driver's education material, tests, and offline driving practice with an instructor to customers that need help passing the driver's ed. exams. 

What did you do particularly well?
- I think my design was really well done.  I also think that my class diagram was particularly well done.  I think there are a few things that could be tweaked to make them better.  If I were to implement this into a real application I would need to evaluate those changes. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I think I'd adjust my Use Case Diagram.  I would expand it to include everything that it needs.  I feel like certain items were shorted because I was running out of time to finish that specific diagram.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpretted the user's needs by reading through interview questions and determining the most important aspects of the design based on when it was brought up in conversation and how much emphasis was put on it.  Since we couldn't hear directly from an actual customer I had to make judgement calls on a lot of things.  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Reading through Apple and Android design standards was helpful.  Trying to find other applications that work in a similar fashion and reading through their design standards is also helpful.  This helps get a basic idea of what is expected in the market and how I can implement aspects into my design.
